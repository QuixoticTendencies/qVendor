qVendor
=======

A WoW addon to help you vendor stuff...

Simply adds a button to the vendor window which, when you interact with it, does one of various things.

[Left-Click] : Sells all poor-quality (grey) items immediately, prints to chat the item links (one per line), and prints the total gold earned at the end.

[Shift] + [Right-Click] : Sells all items of any quality from your leftmost (in most UIs) non-empty non-profession-specific bag.
